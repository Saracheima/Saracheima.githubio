           <h2><strong>1. Attend the changing of the guard at Buckingham Palace<br></strong></h2>
          If I had to mention just one <strong>emblematic tourist attraction in London,</strong>  <br>
          It would surely be this one: <strong>
the relief of the Royal Guard in front of the Queen of England's palace.<br></strong>
It is an opportunity to see an <strong>amazing show </strong>and immerse yourself in the world of the English monarchy.

       <h2><strong>
          2. Walking around Hyde Park <br></strong></h2>
          Hyde Park is <strong> the largest green space in the city.</strong> 
      <br>Like Central Park in New York or Mount Royal Park in <br> Montreal, 
      Canada,  it is one of <strong>the most beautiful city parks in the world. <br></strong> 

A walk in Hyde Park is a <strong>must during a stay in London.</strong> 
 <br>It is also <strong> the ideal place to have a picnic </strong>in  summer, or to have lunch on the terrace by the water.

          3. Celebrate in the Soho district <br></strong></h2>
          We continue this tourist guide of London by <strong>the district of Soho.</strong> <br>
          Soho is one of <strong>the smallest districts in London</strong>, but it is also <strong>the most lively</strong>. <br>
        <strong> Soho is the centre of London's nightlife</strong> and home to all the hottest <strong>pubs, theatres, restaurants,<br> cinemas and discos.</strong>

       <h2><strong>
          4. Piccadilly Circus<br></strong></h2>
          Piccadilly Circus is the city's essential crossroads, and <strong>the emblem of modern </strong> and commercial <br>
           London. Indeed, it is impossible not to have in mind <strong>the image of this animated square </strong> with huge <br>
            advertising screens that broadcast ads 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. <br>
It's a bit like<strong> London Times Square</strong>, in a smaller version.

       <h2><strong>
          5. Covent Garden<br></strong></h2>
          Among the things to see in London, I recommend that you go to Covent Garden. <br>

The London halls were once located in Covent Garden but, having become too small, they moved in <br>
the 1970s.
Covent Garden has fortunately kept its <strong> pretty glass roof</strong>, which is what makes this place so charming,<br>
 and under which <strong>many shops, workshops, restaurants</strong> and even a <strong>museum</strong>, the London Transport <br>
 Museum, are now located.
